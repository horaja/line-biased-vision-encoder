VLA PROJECT

Some Notes:
-> selective_magno_vit/data/transforms.py should not be used.
-> slurm/submit_preprocessing and preprocessing scripts are most likely broken.
-> tests directory and slurm/submit_tests.py are broken.
-> spatial transforms are not implemented currently
-> patch sizes and image sizes NEED to be fixed, as projection logic has not yet been implemented
