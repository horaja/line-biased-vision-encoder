- [ ] Investigate the implications of multinomial sampling.
  - Figure out how to semi-reliably visualize selected indices of collection of images
    - worst case: just run multinomial sampling many times, take average or whatever.
- [x] Update `SelectiveMagnoViT` to use projected indices.
  - [ ] In the future, create a more logical implementation
- [x] Fix configuration loading in `scripts/train.py` and `selective_magno_vit/data/dataset.py`.
- [x] Update `visualizer.py` and `evaluator.py` and trainer
- [x] Update transforms, visualize_results, evaluate.
- [ ] Update all slurm scripts
- [ ] Update tests in `tests/`.
